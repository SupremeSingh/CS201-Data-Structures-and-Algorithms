# CS201: Data Structures and Algorithms
Code from assignments and projects related to the introductory data structures and algorithms course at Duke University.\

Course Description -

Analysis, use, and design of data structures and algorithms using an object-oriented language like Java to solve computational problems. Emphasis on abstraction including interfaces and abstract data types for lists, trees, sets, tables/maps, and graphs. Implementation and evaluation of programming techniques including recursion. Intuitive and rigorous analysis of algorithms.

Course Goals -

- Design, develop, debug, and test a Java program that uses appropriate standard libraries to solve the problem efficiently.
- Write programs that effectively implement and use data structures such as: arrays, maps, linked lists, stacks, trees, and graphs.
- Evaluate the time and space complexity of iterative and recursively-defined algorithms using empirical and mathematical analysis.
